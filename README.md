Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?

  [Here](https://catsplash-q.vercel.app/)
  
- What was your experience?

  My experience was good but challenging. This is the first time I have used NextAuth for user authentication, it is easy to understand. On the backend side, my experience was a bit complicated, since I had to be in charge of validating all the data and protecting routes to avoid unwanted requests.
  
- What have you learned/improved?

  I learned to use NextAuth, to manage the user session, to create an internal API to be able to make the necessary requests, to get on the client's side to understand and apply a better user experience. I also learned how to upload images to Cloudinary and everything that goes behind it to be able to use the platform. Create the database with the fields necessary for the correct functioning of the application. additional validations such as that an image can be uploaded correctly, that the link of the post to be added is valid, validate the inputs depending on what is needed
  
- Your wisdom? :)

  Everything is possible with patience and creativity.
